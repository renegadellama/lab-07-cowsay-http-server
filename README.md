Cow Server

Author, Isak Swearingen

Description: Cow Server is a back end http server built with Node.js that brings up the image of a text cow with a custom message in a speech bubble which is the body of the request.  This exercise was designed to practice setting up an http server, using url's, headers and bodies.  It also allows users to get and to post.

Scripts:
To run server: npm run launch
To use linter: npm run lint 
To run tests: npm run test
